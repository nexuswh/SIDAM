Content of this folder:

"Igor Procedures" and "User Procedures" contains a macro file.
"Utilities" contains some files which may be useful.


How to install:

1. Find Igor Pro User Files Folder (UserFiles). You can find it by selecting Igor Pro menu, Misc > Miscellaneous Settings > Igor User Files.

2. Copy Kohsaka Macro.ipf to \UserFiles\Igor Procedures.

3. Copy KM folder to \UserFiles\User Procedures.

If you use Windows Vista or later, and have not changed the location of \UserFiles, install.bat in Utilities folder is also avaiable to install the macro files.


How to update:

1. Remove old macro files except those in the extension folder.
2. Install new files as above except the extension folder.
3. Start the macro (alternatively open KM.itx in Utilities folder).

Do not forget #3. If you skip #3 and open an existing experiment file, a compile error may occur.

If you use Windows Vista or later and have not changed the location of \UserFiles, update.bat in Utilities folder is avaiable as an alternative of the above steps 1 and 2. You still need to do the step 3.
